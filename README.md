## Pull Request Previews

When you open a pull request, a preview of your changes will automatically be deployed to a temporary URL. This makes it easy to review and test changes before merging. The preview URL will be posted as a comment on your PR and will look like:

`https://d4koon.github.io/Holiday-Planner/pr-<number>/`

The preview updates automatically with new commits and is cleaned up when the PR is closed.
